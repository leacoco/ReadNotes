Scripting:

In sed and awk, each instruction has two parts:
  A Pattern and a Procedure
  PATTERN: is a regular expression delimated with slashes ( / )
  PROCEDURE: specifies one or more actions to be performed.


Syntax:
  sed -f scriptfile inputfile

  awk ' instructions ' files
  awk -f script files
